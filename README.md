This is a fork of instant-generics (https://github.com/dreixel/instant-generics), an extension to generic programming libraries in Haskell to support indexed data types (GADTs), allowing the automatic derivation of generic instances (such as equality, enumeration, etc.) for these types. Is a generic programming library based on type classes and type families first described by Chakravarty et al. (see http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~chak/project/generics/). The current release implements the extensions to support indexed datatypes described in:

    José Pedro Magalhães and Johan Jeuring. Generic Programming for Indexed Datatypes. Draft version, 2011. http://dreixel.net/research/pdf/gpid_draft.pdf

instant-generics is used in HarmTrace (https://hackage.haskell.org/package/HarmTrace): Harmony Analysis and Retrieval of Music, with Type-level Representations of Abstract Chords Entities. I wanted study and build HarmTrace, but it depends form instant-generics, so that I had to delve into instant-generics to make the necessary changes to compile it on current versions of ghc. I managed to get it to compile with version 9.4.8. I recommend reading Generic Programming for Indexed Datatypes (http://dreixel.net/research/pdf/gpid_draft.pdf).
